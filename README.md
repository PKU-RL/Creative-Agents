# Creative Agents: Empowering Agents with Imagination for Creative Tasks


We propose **Creative Agents**, the first framework that can handle creative tasks in an open-ended world. Using this framework, we implement various embodied agents through different combinations of imaginators and controllers. **Creative Agents** is an initial attempt in this field, aimed at raising the awareness of building intelligent agents with creativity.
